                <h2>Game Design Research</h2>
                <p>I enjoyed reading Amir Dori’s article on <a href="https://uxplanet.org/game-design-ux-best-practices-guide-4a3078c32099">Game Design UX Best Practices</a>, as games and game design is something that has always been pretty interesting to me. When I first think of game design, I usually think about the design of the actual gameplay itself, however there are plenty of other interactions made outside of the actual gameplay that designers design very meticulously. The best practices in the article focused on a lot more subtle design choices that come with interactions in mobile games. I found it really interesting to see how much thought is put into elements such as the placements of certain game visuals or the color choices for certain buttons; however, this also wasn’t very surprising as this type of thought and detail is put into almost all applications we use nowadays.</p>
                <p>Something the article mentioned that I hadn’t really heard about before was “dark UX.” While the article provided context on the idea, I looked a bit further into it and learned that dark UX is basically when designers create experiences that push users to benefit the company rather than the user. In game design, it seems obvious that companies might need to implement some dark UX to increase profits, etc., but when seeing these patterns in other sites and contexts, I never really gave the idea a label. I think I will now be more aware of when I see dark UX in games and other places.</p>

                <h2>Visual Thinking Analysis</h2>
                <div class="images">
                    <figure>
                        <img src="images/walldecor.png" alt="wall decor" height="260">

                        <figcaption>Figure 2: Brenda Padron</figcaption>
                    </figure>
                </div>

                <p>The image on the left (Figure 1) is of the wall decor above my desk! A lot of these items and pictures I’ve collected represent parts of my memories, personality, and interests. The variety of items include many different shapes, colors, materials, and express different emotions — from the shine of the polaroid photos, to the pastel colors of the different prints. Just by looking at the wall, you wouldn’t know how long I’ve been collecting these different prints and knick knacks, how I got them, or how they relate to me personally. For example, The sticker in the middle with pink graphic words reading “dreamin’ of summer daze” is from Dutch Bros. Since moving to Davis, I have lived pretty close by to the store and have made it a goal to collect as many of their monthly stickers as I can. Throughout the year, I’ve able to treat myself to my favorite drinks or share the experience with others on these days.</p>
                <p>All of these different elements help tell the viewer a little bit more about who I am and what I’m about. For some, it may sound a bit trivial to collect something like stickers from a coffee shop, but to me, it’s a simple joy that I’ve really loved about my time in Davis.</p>

                <p>For my classmate’s image on the right (Figure 2), I get a similar feel in that the items on the bookshelf can tell me a lot about what types of activities or items this person enjoys. The image uses a lot of muted colors, but there is also a great variety of colors. I really love the subtleness of the Christmas/string lights that wrap around part of the structure; they have a slightly bright saturation than the other items on the bookshelf which helps them still stand out. I also really enjoy the playfulness and gracefulness in a lot of the spatial relations between the objects, from some items being in front of others, to items leaning against others, etc.</p>
                <p>Some of the obvious aspects of the piece could include that this is likely a bookshelf this person has in their home. It looks like there are a lot of personal knick knacks on the shelves, some of which that they may have collected from where they have traveled or visited. On the other hand, many of the items are subtle but probably carry a lot of meaning. For example, I’m curious about the little, orange, cat-looking item on the bottom right shelf (as well as many of the other figurines and books around). Are the lights on the shelf there for the season, or are they left year round for decoration? Things like this can say a lot about a person and could definitely be expanded on more to create a super interesting story.</p>

                <h2>Visual Thinking Strategies Research</h2>
                <p>I really loved to see how the simple “What’s Going On” activity has been so helpful for teaching close reading and visual thinking skills to other students. It’s a much more easy and unintimidating way to start practicing these skills than by doing a typical assignment. Like the article mentioned, I also oftentimes skim things when they might take more attention to fully absorb. This probably leads me to not being able to fully understand what an image or text has to offer. Thinking of other visuals and texts in the same manner as in the “What’s Going On” activity might help me take a step back more often and really take the time to fully look at something.</p>
                <p>Furthermore, I found that the three questions created by Visual Thinking Strategies are ones I can keep in mind to help me remember to take a step further and think of how I can find evidence to support my thoughts. I think this is a skill that will be useful not only in a visual sense but in my other classes where more text is more heavily involved as well.</p>
                <p>After looking on the <a href="https://www.awwwards.com/">Awwwards.com</a> website, I came across the Site of the Day for February 7, 2023. The site titled <a href="https://summer-afternoon.vlucendo.com/">Summer Afternoon</a> by Vicente Lucendo was a super cool interactive website that was almost game-like. The user is able to walk through an interactive town made up of 3D artwork. While there may not be a super deep backstory to this 3D generated town, I was able to practice the visual thinking strategies through exploring the different aspects of the town and thinking about why certain design decisions were made. It was nice to be able to apply the visual thinking skills in an interactive mode.</p>

                <h2>Overlay and Modal Design</h2>
                <p>I hadn’t really realized it before, but it really is true how modals and overlays in today’s world have become more of a “dreaded pop-up window.” I myself have encountered long and frustrating modals that often get me to think “why is this even in a modal?” While there are benefits to using overlays as the article mentioned (grabbing the user’s attention, conveying urgent information, etc.), reading the two articles on overlay design reiterated the idea of designing all things with intention. When thinking of when to use overlays, one should consider whether it is actually necessary by considering for who, what, why, and where it is being used. </p>
                <p>The article also provided a lot of helpful best practices in the case that using a modal/overlay is appropriate. For example, trying to only use overlays when they are user initiated or considering how modals might obstruct mobile users can help to minimize confusion and frustration. Other best practices I’ll be sure to reference include creating clear labels for titles and buttons to clearly communicate where the user is and what action the user is about to perform to not only reduce confusion but build trust. When sites have confusing pop-ups and navigation, I often feel that it is less trustworthy and that I need to make sure I don’t click on anything weird. As a user, I’ve encounter a lot of the issues mentioned in the articles, and while I never gave it too much thought before, I’ll now be able to keep these in mind when taking on any modal and overlay design.</p>

                <h2>Best Practices for Form Design</h2>
                <p>From reading the <a href="https://uxdesign.cc/best-practices-for-form-design-ff5de6ca8e5f">Best Practices for Form Design</a> article, I’ve learned that like with all user experience focused design, we want to help users achieve their goals in the most easy and enjoyable way. The article mentioned common tactics such as easing users into the process by placing simpler questions upfront, and making sure to put clear labels and placeholder text to make users do the least amount of work. It was helpful to see these ideas reinforced, and because we had just learned about the HTML form element, I was able to make connections between how to use the "label" and "input" tags we learned about to implement these best practices.</p>
                <p>The article also mentioned key elements, that while I didn’t immediately think of, can play a huge part in improving one’s experience when filling out forms. For example, making a form tab-ready — its annoying when you encounter a form that isn’t, but it’s not necessarily something I think of right away. Another thing I took away was to pay close attention to accessibility in things like color contrast, text size, and even the way to design effective action buttons. Overall, this is was a great resource to look at for form design and I’ll definitely keep it to refer back to in the future!</p>
