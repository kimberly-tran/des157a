                <h2>Best Practices for Form Design</h2>
                <p>From reading the <a href="https://uxdesign.cc/best-practices-for-form-design-ff5de6ca8e5f">Best Practices for Form Design</a> article, I’ve learned that like with all user experience focused design, we want to help users achieve their goals in the most easy and enjoyable way. The article mentioned common tactics such as easing users into the process by placing simpler questions upfront, and making sure to put clear labels and placeholder text to make users do the least amount of work. It was helpful to see these ideas reinforced, and because we had just learned about the HTML form element, I was able to make connections between how to use the "label" and "input" tags we learned about to implement these best practices.</p>
                <p>The article also mentioned key elements, that while I didn’t immediately think of, can play a huge part in improving one’s experience when filling out forms. For example, making a form tab-ready — its annoying when you encounter a form that isn’t, but it’s not necessarily something I think of right away. Another thing I took away was to pay close attention to accessibility in things like color contrast, text size, and even the way to design effective action buttons. Overall, this is was a great resource to look at for form design and I’ll definitely keep it to refer back to in the future!</p>
