                <h2>Visual Thinking Strategies Research</h2>
                <p>I really loved to see how the simple “What’s Going On” activity has been so helpful for teaching close reading and visual thinking skills to other students. It’s a much more easy and unintimidating way to start practicing these skills than by doing a typical assignment. Like the article mentioned, I also oftentimes skim things when they might take more attention to fully absorb. This probably leads me to not being able to fully understand what an image or text has to offer. Thinking of other visuals and texts in the same manner as in the “What’s Going On” activity might help me take a step back more often and really take the time to fully look at something.</p>
                <p>Furthermore, I found that the three questions created by Visual Thinking Strategies are ones I can keep in mind to help me remember to take a step further and think of how I can find evidence to support my thoughts. I think this is a skill that will be useful not only in a visual sense but in my other classes where more text is more heavily involved as well.</p>
                <p>After looking on the <a href="https://www.awwwards.com/">Awwwards.com</a> website, I came across the Site of the Day for February 7, 2023. The site titled <a href="https://summer-afternoon.vlucendo.com/">Summer Afternoon</a> by Vicente Lucendo was a super cool interactive website that was almost game-like. The user is able to walk through an interactive town made up of 3D artwork. While there may not be a super deep backstory to this 3D generated town, I was able to practice the visual thinking strategies through exploring the different aspects of the town and thinking about why certain design decisions were made. It was nice to be able to apply the visual thinking skills in an interactive mode. </p>

                <h2>Overlay and Modal Design</h2>
                <p>I hadn’t really realized it before, but it really is true how modals and overlays in today’s world have become more of a “dreaded pop-up window.” I myself have encountered long and frustrating modals that often get me to think “why is this even in a modal?” While there are benefits to using overlays as the article mentioned (grabbing the user’s attention, conveying urgent information, etc.), reading the two articles on overlay design reiterated the idea of designing all things with intention. When thinking of when to use overlays, one should consider whether it is actually necessary by considering for who, what, why, and where it is being used. </p>
                <p>The article also provided a lot of helpful best practices in the case that using a modal/overlay is appropriate. For example, trying to only use overlays when they are user initiated or considering how modals might obstruct mobile users can help to minimize confusion and frustration. Other best practices I’ll be sure to reference include creating clear labels for titles and buttons to clearly communicate where the user is and what action the user is about to perform to not only reduce confusion but build trust. When sites have confusing pop-ups and navigation, I often feel that it is less trustworthy and that I need to make sure I don’t click on anything weird. As a user, I’ve encounter a lot of the issues mentioned in the articles, and while I never gave it too much thought before, I’ll now be able to keep these in mind when taking on any modal and overlay design.</p>

                <h2>Best Practices for Form Design</h2>
                <p>From reading the <a href="https://uxdesign.cc/best-practices-for-form-design-ff5de6ca8e5f">Best Practices for Form Design</a> article, I’ve learned that like with all user experience focused design, we want to help users achieve their goals in the most easy and enjoyable way. The article mentioned common tactics such as easing users into the process by placing simpler questions upfront, and making sure to put clear labels and placeholder text to make users do the least amount of work. It was helpful to see these ideas reinforced, and because we had just learned about the HTML form element, I was able to make connections between how to use the "label" and "input" tags we learned about to implement these best practices.</p>
                <p>The article also mentioned key elements, that while I didn’t immediately think of, can play a huge part in improving one’s experience when filling out forms. For example, making a form tab-ready — its annoying when you encounter a form that isn’t, but it’s not necessarily something I think of right away. Another thing I took away was to pay close attention to accessibility in things like color contrast, text size, and even the way to design effective action buttons. Overall, this is was a great resource to look at for form design and I’ll definitely keep it to refer back to in the future!</p>
