            <h2>User Test Observations</h2>
            <p><strong>1.</strong> From the user testing, I noticed that some people were not completely sure what the middle icon (map) represented before clicking into the icon. Upon asking about this after the testing in the follow-up portion, users expressed that it was a little difficult to see due to the darker colors.</p>
            <p><strong>2.</strong> I also noticed that some people did not even notice or think to activate the sound feature. This may be because they did not assume that there would be sound / if there was sound it would be playing automatically.</p>
            <p><strong>3.</strong> In the follow-up interviews after testing, I asked my users if there was anything they’d like to see improved in the game play since it is currently quite similar to the original code. I received feedback that included adding more animations, changing the copy to fit the theme more, and changing how the game works.</p>

        <section id="implementation">
            <h2>Next Steps</h2>
            <p>To make the all the icons more visible/legible, I plan to change the colors to create more contrast in the illustration details. As for the sound feature, I would’ve liked to have had the sound playing automatically and have the sound button be primarily for muting; however, I don’t think that Chrome supports this feature. Lastly, to improve the overall gameplay experience for my user, I plan to add some animations to create more visual interest on the page as well as adjust the copy to make it more in theme with my project.</p>
